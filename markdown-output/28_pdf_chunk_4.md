We'll keep it short and to the point. We also know lots of books have online materials, and they're often junk. We promise this isn't the case with ours. Before we do that, we’d like to address the relationship between this book and interviewing.io. Yo u ' l l s e e a l o t o f r e fe r e n c e s t o i t . T h i s b o o k i s n o t from interviewing.io, but we do partner with them for access to lots of data, interview replays, and an AI Interviewer. Because of this relationship, we know that sometimes mentioning interviewing.io might sound promotional. We’ve tried to avoid that as much as we could. We hope—trust—that you'll forgive this in exchange for access to lots of data, resources, and tools (and the discount code). The book is roughly split into two segments: the # rst segment (Parts I–V) is the soft squishy stu$ (backed up by a lot of qualitative and quantitative data). The second segment (Parts VI and onwards) is the technical content, which has its own README (pg 168). Please read it before diving into those parts. ONLINE MATERIALS AND DISCUSSION You can access all of our online materials and bonus chapters here: Talk with the authors, get help if you're stuck, and geek out with us on Discord. bctci.co bctci.co/discord __INIT__!" ▸ README 11 ICONS Whenever you see an icon wrapped in a speech bubble, it means that there’s online content that goes with it, like so: Problems, Solutions, and AI Interviewer: Each problem in the book has a Python solution (without any fancy Python-speci# c tricks). We also provide Java, JavaScript, and C++ solutions online. We encourage you to try each problem with AI Interviewer and to only look at the solution if you get stuck. Interview Replay: These are recordings of actual mock interviews from interviewing.io’s collection, conducted by engineers from FAANG and other top companies. We use them to showcase real-life examples of successes and mistakes. Snippet: These are snippets that you can copy and paste. Sometimes they’re code. Sometimes they’re text that you can steal verbatim (e.g., emails to recruiters). Resource or document: These are bonus chapters, downloadable problem sets, or worksheets (e.g., an equity calculator, a calculator to help you # gure out the order in which to approach companies).

HELLO READER. The only thing worse than technical interviews is not having technical interviews. Oscar Wilde(ish) Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI) has been the industry leader in teaching engineers how to get into top tech companies for over a decade. It's referenced in almost every major interview prep source, includ- ing books, podcasts, blogs, and online courses, as the source of truth on how to get into the major tech companies in our industry. And—although this was never the intention—it's even been used as a classroom textbook and a question bank for companies to draw on. So, why write another interview prep book? And why now? While CtCI remains an excellent foundation for interview preparation, the landscape of technical interviews has evolved dramatically since its publication. Online interview resources have changed how candidates practice, and the questions asked in interviews have grown both in di% culty and variety. And, as more candidates are preparing for interviews than ever before, the bar for passing has risen accordingly. But it’s not just the questions that have changed. The process of landing a job at top tech companies has grown even more competitive. The technical interview format has sparked increasing debate, and AI is reshaping how people apply for jobs, how companies screen candidates, and even how interviews are conducted. Amidst these shifts,
